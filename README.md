*(I'm working on the title...)*

This is my attempt at creating something similar to DOOM on my own
(using several tutorials).

## Introduction
I wanted to recreate the legendary DOOM using C (standard C23) and raylib.  
All the graphics are rendered on the CPU because I also wanted to try that.

The code was written in the CLion IDE (JetBrains), settings are stored in the
[`.idea/`](.idea) directory.
Builds for Linux (untested) are done using `gcc`, Windows builds use `MSVC`.


## Building from source
(in development)


## Project structure
(in development)


## License and third-party libraries
The project is licensed under GPL v3.0
(the full license is in the [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt) file).

But the project would not be possible without open-source libraries. They are
used in this project. I want to thank the authors, contributors, maintainers
and sponsors of these third-party libraries.

This project is using:
- [**raylib**](https://www.raylib.com/):
  - **Version**: 5.5 (c1ab645ca298a2801097931d1079b10ff7eb9df8)
  - **Upstream**: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
  - **License**: Zlib
